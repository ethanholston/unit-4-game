Street fighter game created using jQuery and Javascript

All the text on the page is dynamically placed using jQuery. 

Some new things I learned and implemented in this project were:
.detach()
turning .on("click") off and back on. 

I would like to come back to this later to see how I can make it more efficient. There are a huge number of lines devoted solely to updating and replacing text fields.
